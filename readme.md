# ndc-bigquery

Experimental WIP BigQuery NDC.

Forked from `ndc-postgres`.

## Getting started

1. Set up `cargo` and friends for Rust development as per instructions in [ndc-postgres](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-postgres).
2. Get a BigQuery service account key and put it in the
   `HASURA_BIGQUERY_SERVICE_KEY` env var
3. Run `just dev` and see what breaks
